#EZ POOL:  A Fast and Easy Gateway to Saving Money with Pool Together for New Users

Description: 

This is a landing page for cryptocurrency naive users.  Rather than build new tools for easy on boarding, it made more sense to use products that already exist in the eco-system.  This is curated set of tools for quick on and off boarding from Pool Together.  It is built using react so that dynamic components can be added such as the estimated prize amount etc.  

User Flow: 

1.  User will download Argent Wallet to smartphone
2.  User will quickly set up Argent Wallet with email/password, quick set-up of ENS Ethereum address.
3.  User will perform an instant KYC verification in the Argent Wallet and be able to purchase Dai directly with a credit or debit card.
4.  User will be directed to the actual https://app.pooltogether.com and instructed to connect with Wallet Connect.
5.  User can then deposit in pool together
6.  A tutorial for withdrawing from Pool Together and turing Dai back into cash, via coinbase, will be included.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
